    <h1>Nici Le Gear art</h1>
    <p>I have always had an interest in art. From a very young age I would spend my days drawing. I am a self taught artist, after working many years in Digital as a User Experience Designer. 
I love painting, and feel that it allows me to completely relax and get in the zone. I am exploring styles and types of painting. </P>
